## Revit's Time Machine

### Description:
A nice user interface allows you to quickly create Revit filters based of time parameters.

We distinguish 5 cases for filters:
| Case | Colour |
| --- | --- |
| Elements under construction |(_Red_)|
| Elements under demolition |(_Yellow_)| 
| Elements already built |(_Gray_)| 
| Elements not built yet |(_invisible_)|
| Elements already demolished |(_hidden_)|
